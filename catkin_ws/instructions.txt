How to build
    $ cd catkin_ws # this should be your actual catkin_ws path
    $ catkin_make 

if fail during building, due to dependency,  install using following commands and then build again
    $ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

To start simulation, open 3 terminal
    1. 1st terminal, launch platform
        $ cd catkin_ws # this should be your actual catkin_ws path
        $ source devel/setup.bash 
        $ roslaunch multimap_map_merge platform_spawn.launch

    2. 2nd terminal, launch two robots
        $ cd catkin_ws # this should be your actual catkin_ws path
        $ source devel/setup.bash 
        $ roslaunch multimap_map_merge multi_robot.launch

    3. 3rd terminal, launch mapping and multi_map merge
        $ cd catkin_ws # this should be your actual catkin_ws path
        $ source devel/setup.bash 
        $ roslaunch multimap_map_merge multi_map.launch

TO DO MAPPING, you need two more terminal to move the robots, you need to control robot using teleop_twist_keyboard one by one
    4. 4th terminal
        $ cd catkin_ws # this should be your actual catkin_ws path
        $ source devel/setup.bash 
        $ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=tb3_0/cmd_vel

    5. 5th terminal
        $ cd catkin_ws # this should be your actual catkin_ws path
        $ source devel/setup.bash 
        $ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=tb3_1/cmd_vel

How to change platform SLT file,
    1. paste your stl file in catkin_ws/src/multimap_map_merge/meshes/
    2. Edit file catkin_ws/src/multimap_map_merge/urdf/platform.urdf , line 16 and 23 with the new name of the stl
